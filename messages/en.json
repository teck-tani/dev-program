        "a1": "Severance Pay = Average Daily Wage × 30 days × (Service days ÷ 365). The average daily wage is calculated by dividing the total wages for the 3 months before resignation (including base salary, allowances, bonuses, and leave pay) by the total number of days in those 3 months (approximately 91 days).",
        "q2": "Q. Can part-time or contract workers receive severance pay?",
        "a2": "Yes, they can. Regardless of employment type (full-time, contract, or part-time), workers who have been continuously employed for more than 1 year and worked an average of 15+ hours per week over a 4-week period are entitled to severance pay under the Labor Standards Act.",
        "q3": "Q. Are bonuses and annual leave pay included in the calculation?",
        "a3": "Yes, they are included. 3/12 (three months' worth) of annual bonuses and 3/12 of annual leave allowance are factored into the average wage calculation. In this calculator, simply enter the amounts in the 'Total Annual Bonus' and 'Annual Leave Allowance' fields to have them automatically reflected.",
        "q4": "Q. What is the deadline for severance pay payment?",
        "a4": "Employers must pay severance within 14 days of the employee's resignation date. Late payment incurs penalty interest at 20% per annum. However, the deadline may be extended by mutual agreement between the employer and employee.",
        "q5": "Q. Can I get an interim settlement (mid-term withdrawal)?",
        "a5": "In principle, interim settlement of severance pay is prohibited. However, exceptions are allowed for legally specified reasons such as purchasing a home (for non-homeowners), paying rent deposits, medical care for the employee or dependents lasting 6+ months, or natural disasters.",
        "q6": "Q. Is severance pay subject to taxation?",
        "a6": "Yes, severance pay is subject to retirement income tax. The tax is calculated based on your years of service and total severance amount, with longer service periods receiving greater deduction benefits. The amount shown in this calculator is pre-tax, so your actual take-home amount will be lower after tax deductions."
